# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using pnpm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Analytics Component Integration
- **Modified:** `app/layout.tsx`
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after `{children}` as recommended

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added to the root layout file following Next.js App Router best practices:
- Placed inside the body tag to ensure it loads on all pages
- Positioned after the children content to avoid blocking page rendering
- No configuration needed - the component works out of the box when deployed to Vercel

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ Build completed successfully with `pnpm run build`
✅ Linter passed with no errors using `pnpm run lint`
✅ No tests available in the project to run
✅ All lock files properly updated

## Files Modified

1. `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
2. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
3. `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new package dependencies

The implementation follows the official Vercel Analytics documentation and preserves all existing code structure and functionality.
